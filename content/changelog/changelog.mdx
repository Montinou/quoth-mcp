**Quoth v2.0: AI Memory Architecture** - Transform from Agentic RAG to AI Memory

This release fundamentally transforms Quoth from a documentation auditor into a true AI Memory system with bidirectional learning.

**Core Architecture Changes**

- **Local-first storage** - `.quoth/` folder structure persists knowledge across sessions
- **quoth-memory subagent** - Sonnet-powered memory interface for context queries (~500 token summaries)
- **Session logging** - All actions logged to `.quoth/sessions/{id}/` for knowledge capture
- **Knowledge promotion** - User-approved transfer: session → local → remote Quoth

**New Skills**

- `/quoth-init` - Initialize AI Memory for a project with configuration wizard
- Genesis v3.0 - Added Phase 0 configuration for strictness and knowledge types

**Configurable Strictness Levels**

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `blocking` | Cannot edit code until reasoning documented |
| `reminder` | Gentle prompts, not blocking |
| `off` | Manual capture only |

**New Hooks**

- `PreToolUse (Edit/Write)` - Gate enforcement with configurable strictness
- `PostToolUse (Edit/Write/Bash)` - Log actions to session folder
- `SubagentStart/Stop` - Context injection for other subagents (excludes quoth-memory)
- Updated `Stop` hook - Knowledge promotion prompt at session end

**Local Folder Structure**

```
.quoth/
├── config.json         # Strictness, types, gates
├── decisions.md        # Architecture choices
├── patterns.md         # Code patterns
├── errors.md           # Failures and fixes
├── knowledge.md        # General context
└── sessions/{id}/      # Session-scoped logs
```

**Breaking Changes**

- Plugin version bumped to 2.0.0
- New folder structure requires `/quoth-init` for existing projects
- Hook token overhead increased slightly for enhanced features

**Quoth Plugin for Claude Code** - Lightweight hooks and adaptive guidelines

The new Quoth Plugin replaces heavy persona prompts with an efficient, autonomous integration:

- **`quoth_guidelines` tool** - One adaptive tool with three modes (`code`, `review`, `document`) replacing three separate personas. Compact (~150 tokens) or full (~500 tokens) guidelines on demand.
- **Lightweight hooks** - ~60 tokens per session instead of ~750. Gentle hints that strongly suggest, not force.
- **Badge enforcement** - 🪶 feather badge displays which patterns were applied when Quoth tools are used.
- **92% token reduction** - Hooks dropped from ~750 to ~60 tokens. Full guidelines from 6,000 to 500 tokens.

**Two-Command Install:**
```bash
# Add marketplace (one time)
/plugin marketplace add Montinou/quoth-mcp

# Install plugin (includes MCP + hooks + skills)
/plugin install quoth@quoth-marketplace
```

The plugin bundles the MCP server, lightweight hooks, and the `/quoth-genesis` skill. For MCP-only usage without hooks, you can still install via `claude mcp add`.

**Production Hardening** - Security and reliability improvements

- Rate limiting on MCP endpoints (60 requests/minute)
- Security headers via middleware (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- Input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints
- Public demo endpoint at `/api/mcp/public` (read-only, no auth required)
- Improved error handling with structured error responses
- Token validation improvements for API keys

**Insights Dashboard** - Documentation health monitoring

The Analytics page now tracks documentation health with four new features:

- **Drift Detection** - Timeline view showing when code diverged from docs, with severity levels (critical, warning, info) and one-click resolution
- **Health Dashboard** - Visual staleness indicators (fresh &lt;14d, aging 14-30d, stale 30-60d, critical &gt;60d) with health score gauge
- **Miss Rate Analytics** - Track searches returning no results to identify documentation gaps
- **Weekly Health Reports** - Automated email reports to project admins every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC via GitHub Actions

**Genesis v2.0** - Configurable documentation depth

- Added depth levels: `minimal` (3 docs), `standard` (5 docs), `comprehensive` (11 docs)
- Genesis now asks for confirmation before starting
- Incremental document upload (no batching)
- Better error handling and progress feedback

**Dashboard Improvements**

- New team management interface
- Role-based access control (admin/editor/viewer)
- Invitation system with email notifications
- API key management with expiration

**Search Enhancements**

### 2026-01-08

**MCP Protocol Updates**
