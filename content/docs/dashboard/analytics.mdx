The Analytics page provides comprehensive insights into your documentation health and usage patterns.

## Accessing Analytics

Navigate to **Dashboard → Analytics** or visit `https://quoth.ai-innovation.site/dashboard/analytics`.

## Usage Statistics

The top section shows key metrics for your selected time period (7, 30, or 90 days):

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Queries** | All MCP tool calls |
| **Searches** | `quoth_search_index` calls |
| **Doc Reads** | `quoth_read_doc` calls |
| **Avg Results/Search** | Average documents returned per search |

## Health Dashboard

The Health Dashboard visualizes documentation freshness across your project.

### Health Score

A 0-100 score indicating overall documentation health:

| Score | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 80-100 | Excellent | Documentation is well-maintained |
| 60-79 | Good | Some documents need attention |
| 40-59 | Fair | Multiple stale documents |
| 0-39 | Critical | Immediate attention required |

### Staleness Levels

Documents are categorized by how recently they were updated:

| Level | Age | Color |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Fresh** | < 14 days | Green |
| **Aging** | 14-30 days | Yellow |
| **Stale** | 30-60 days | Orange |
| **Critical** | > 60 days | Red |

### Documents Needing Attention

A prioritized list of documents that should be reviewed, sorted by staleness severity.

## Drift Detection

The Drift Timeline shows events where code diverged from documentation.

### Drift Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `code_diverged` | Implementation doesn't match documented pattern |
| `missing_doc` | Code exists without documentation |
| `stale_doc` | Document hasn't been updated alongside code |
| `pattern_violation` | Code violates a documented convention |

### Severity Levels

- **Critical** (red) - Significant inconsistency requiring immediate attention
- **Warning** (amber) - Notable drift that should be addressed
- **Info** (blue) - Minor inconsistency or informational

### Resolving Drift

Click **Resolve** on any drift event to mark it as addressed. You can add a resolution note explaining the fix.

<Callout type="tip">
  Use the "Show resolved" toggle to review previously addressed drift events.
</Callout>

## Miss Rate Analytics

Track searches that returned no results to identify documentation gaps.

### Miss Rate Chart

Shows the percentage of searches with zero results over time. A decreasing trend indicates improving documentation coverage.

### Top Missed Queries

Lists the most frequently searched terms that returned no results. Use this to prioritize which documentation to add.

<Callout type="info">
  High miss count for a query = high demand for that topic. Prioritize documenting these areas.
</Callout>
