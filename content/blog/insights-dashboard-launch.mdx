Documentation drift is silent but deadly. Your codebase evolves daily, but how do you know when your docs fall behind? Today we're launching the **Insights Dashboard** - comprehensive monitoring that makes documentation health visible, measurable, and actionable.

## The Problem: Documentation Drift

Every team has experienced this: you confidently tell your AI to follow the documented patterns, but the code it generates doesn't match reality. Why? Because the docs describe how things *were*, not how they *are*.

Until now, there was no easy way to:

- **Detect drift** - When did code and docs diverge?
- **Measure staleness** - Which docs need urgent attention?
- **Identify gaps** - What questions can't your docs answer?

## Introducing the Insights Dashboard

Your Analytics page now includes four new capabilities designed to keep your documentation healthy:

<CardGrid>
  <Card
    title="Drift Detection"
    description="Timeline view of when code diverged from documentation"
    icon="GitBranch"
  />
  <Card
    title="Health Dashboard"
    description="Visual staleness indicators with severity levels"
    icon="HeartPulse"
  />
  <Card
    title="Miss Rate Analytics"
    description="Track searches that return no results"
    icon="SearchX"
  />
  <Card
    title="Weekly Reports"
    description="Automated health reports sent to your inbox"
    icon="Mail"
  />
</CardGrid>

## Drift Detection

The new **Drift Timeline** shows you exactly when code started diverging from documentation. Each drift event includes:

- **Severity level** - Critical (red), Warning (amber), or Info (blue)
- **Drift type** - Code diverged, missing doc, stale doc, or pattern violation
- **Side-by-side comparison** - What the doc says vs. what the code does
- **One-click resolution** - Mark issues as resolved with notes

<Callout type="info">
  Drift events are detected automatically when you run audits or when MCP tools identify inconsistencies during code generation.
</Callout>

## Health Dashboard

The **Health Dashboard** provides a bird's-eye view of your documentation freshness:

| Status | Age | Action |
|--------|-----|--------|
| **Fresh** | < 14 days | No action needed |
| **Aging** | 14-30 days | Review soon |
| **Stale** | 30-60 days | Update recommended |
| **Critical** | > 60 days | Immediate attention |

The dashboard includes:

- **Health Score** (0-100) - Overall documentation health gauge
- **Staleness Distribution** - Visual breakdown of fresh/aging/stale/critical
- **Documents Needing Attention** - Prioritized list of what to update first

## Miss Rate Analytics

Ever wonder what questions your documentation *can't* answer? The **Miss Rate Chart** tracks:

- Searches that returned zero results
- Trending missed queries over time
- Top 5 most-missed search terms

This data reveals gaps in your knowledge base. If users keep searching for "authentication flow" and finding nothing, that's a doc you need to write.

<Callout type="tip">
  Use the miss rate data to prioritize your documentation backlog. High miss count = high demand for that topic.
</Callout>

## Weekly Health Reports

Stay informed without checking the dashboard daily. Every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC, project admins receive an email report including:

- Overall health score and trend
- Drift event summary (critical/warning/info counts)
- Miss rate statistics
- Direct link to the Analytics dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Automatic** - No setup required for existing projects
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Admin-only** - Reports go to users with admin role
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Actionable** - Each section links to relevant dashboard views
  </Step>
</Steps>
