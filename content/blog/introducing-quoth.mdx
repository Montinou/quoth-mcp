Building software with AI agents is powerful—but there's a catch. Your AI doesn't actually know your codebase. It hallucinates patterns, invents APIs that don't exist, and confidently generates code that contradicts your architecture.

**Quoth changes that.**

## The Problem with AI-Assisted Development

When you ask an AI to write code for your project, it's essentially guessing. It doesn't know:

- Your testing patterns and conventions
- Your API schemas and data models
- Your architectural decisions and their rationale
- The actual structure of your codebase

The result? Code that looks right but doesn't fit. Tests that follow the wrong patterns. Components that don't match your design system.

## Enter Quoth: Your Single Source of Truth

Quoth is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that acts as an auditor between your AI and your codebase. It provides:

    icon="Search"
  />
  <Card
    title="Pattern Enforcement"
    description="Ensure AI-generated code follows your documented standards"
    icon="Shield"
  />
  <Card
    title="Living Documentation"
    description="Keep docs in sync with code through proposal workflows"
    icon="RefreshCw"
  />
</CardGrid>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Connect Quoth to your AI tool** via MCP protocol (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Run Genesis** to automatically document your codebase structure and patterns
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Activate the Architect persona** before writing code to enforce documented patterns
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Get Started Today

Quoth is available now with a free tier for individual developers. Check out our [Quick Start Guide](/docs/getting-started/quick-start) to connect your first project.

<Callout type="tip">
  Already using Claude Code? Add Quoth with the plugin installer:
  ```bash
  # Add the Quoth marketplace (one time)
  /plugin marketplace add Montinou/quoth-mcp

  # Install the plugin
  /plugin install quoth@quoth-marketplace
  ```
</Callout>

We can't wait to see what you build with AI that actually understands your code.
