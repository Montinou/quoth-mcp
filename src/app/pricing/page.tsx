  {
    question: "What is a knowledge base document?",
    answer:
      "A knowledge base document is any markdown file with YAML frontmatter that defines patterns, contracts, or architecture documentation. Quoth indexes these files and makes them searchable for AI agents.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are MCP tool calls counted?",
    answer:
      "Each invocation of quoth_search_index, quoth_read_doc, or quoth_propose_update counts as one tool call. Calls are counted per minute with a rolling window.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I self-host Quoth?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Quoth is open source and can be self-hosted. The pricing tiers apply to our hosted service at quoth.ai-innovation.site. Self-hosting is free but requires your own infrastructure.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in custom personas?",
    answer:
      "Custom personas allow you to define specialized AI behaviors beyond the default Architect and Auditor. You can create personas for specific domains like 'Security Auditor' or 'Performance Reviewer' with custom rules.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does team collaboration work?",
    answer:
      "Team collaboration allows multiple developers to share a knowledge base, review proposed updates, and manage AI personas together. Changes to documentation are tracked with full audit history.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a free trial for Pro?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Pro tier includes a 14-day free trial with full access to all features. No credit card required to start.",
